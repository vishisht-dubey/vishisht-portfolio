				YO ü§òüèª, what's up? I am Vishisht Dubey, a student at the Indian Institute of
				Technology (BHU) Varanasi, and I am passionate about software building
				and open source and computer science fundamentals.<br/><br/>
				I started my programming journey with python and have loved programming ever since. I
				proceeded in my programming journey by making games like tic-tac-toe and
				drum play. Later, I contributed to the tech-team of the training and
				placement cell of my clg. After that, I contributed to a couple of
				startups like <a  href="https://www.linkedin.com/company/mquotient/about/" target="_blank" className="dark:text-emerald-400 text-emerald-500">mquotient</a>,<a href="https://www.linkedin.com/company/talentedhippo/" target="_blank" className="dark:text-emerald-400 text-emerald-500">talentedHippo</a> and also contributed to tech-team of <a  href="https://www.linkedin.com/company/ecelliitbhu/" target="_blank" className="dark:text-emerald-400 text-emerald-500">E-Cell</a>. I am learning about
				cloud technologies like Docker, Kubernetes, and Terraform, and I also
				learned a bit about the Azure cloud. I am familiar with
				javascript/typescript, reactjs, expressjs, python, django and
				react-redux. I love to build scalable web applications.
				<br/><br/> I learn about
				data structures and algorithms in my free time, and my preferred
				language is C++.<br/><br/>I'm always looking to collaborate on interesting
				projects and exciting work opportunities. Get in touch or Ask me
